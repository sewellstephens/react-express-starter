# Krastie AI app

This is the Krastie AI app.

### Heres a few things to know before running the app:

- The app is built with React, but uses Express server for API routes.

- The app uses MongoDB for the database.

- setTimeout is used in several places to prevent code from running before the browser is ready.

- Environment variables are required for the app to run. Also see server README.md

### Caddyfile

The Caddyfile is used to serve the app. It is located in the root of the client directory.
